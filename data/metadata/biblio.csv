Lake Rotorua fixed buoy data,"This dataset contains high-frequency environmental measurements collected by a fixed sensor buoy deployed in Lake Rotorua. The buoy was equipped with a temperature string spanning the water column, along with surface sensors for pH, chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and dissolved oxygen. Additional dissolved oxygen measurements were recorded at the lake bottom. A meteorological station mounted on the buoy recorded atmospheric conditions including wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. These observations support the characterization of physical, chemical, and biological dynamics in Lake Rotorua over time.",,,"lake monitoring, high-frequency data, sensor buoy, water quality, meteorological measurements",CC BY 4.0,Bay of Plenty Regional Council,Lake Rotorua in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand.,-38.0328,176.3276,-38.142,176.2125,,2007-07-13 14:45,2022-02-02 15:00
